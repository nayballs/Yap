# Integrations: local API and MCP

The token-authenticated local API, Yap's MCP server (`yap.exe mcp`) and adding it to AI apps' configs, plus the Integrations view. See also [`docs/local-api.md`](../local-api.md).

## Modules

- **`bridge.rs`** — the **local API bridge** (OpenWhispr `cliBridge.js` port,
  backs the Integrations view): a token-authenticated loopback HTTP server
  (`tiny_http`, `127.0.0.1`, OS-assigned port) exposing `/v1` REST routes over
  notes/folders/history so terminals + coding agents can drive Yap data.
  Discovery = `~/.yap/cli-bridge.json` `{version, port, token}` (fixed path,
  written on start, deleted on exit); auth = `Bearer <token>` (SHA-256
  constant-time compare); note mutations emit `yap-notes-changed` so NotesView
  refreshes live. Toggled by `config.bridge_enabled` (default on; `sync()`
  runs at setup + every config save). A second Yap (dev next to installed)
  leaves a live bridge's file alone, and `stop()` only deletes the file while
  it's still ours. Also serves the MCP server's meeting views
  (`/v1/meetings/list`, `/v1/meetings/search`, `/v1/mcp/config`; built in
  `mcp.rs`). Debug builds take `YAP_BRIDGE_FILE` to move the discovery file
  (the e2e suite). See `docs/local-api.md`.
- **`mcp.rs`** — **Yap's MCP server** (Wispr Flow's Notetaker MCP, local): AI apps
  launch **`yap.exe mcp`** (main.rs sends that argument here before any of the app
  starts: no window, tray, hook or single-instance check; release builds are
  GUI-subsystem and inherit the client's stdio pipes fine) and speak MCP over
  stdin/stdout via `rmcp`, which serves both eras (the 2025 `initialize` handshake
  and 2026-07-28's per-request `_meta` + `server/discover`). The process holds no
  data: every tool calls the **running** Yap's local API (discovery file re-read per
  call), so notes.json keeps one writer; with Yap closed or the Local API off, tools
  answer "Open Yap to let your AI read your notes". Tools, meetings + notes only,
  **never dictation history**: `list_meetings`, `search_meetings` (matching
  transcript lines + page), `get_meeting` (AI summary/action plan, typed notes,
  digests when there's no summary, transcript in ~6k-token pages via
  `transcript_page`), `search_notes`, `get_note`, `list_folders`, and `create_note`
  only when `config.mcp_allow_writes` (Settings → MCP; source `"mcp"`). Markdown
  for the model, local-time dates (chrono). Transcript lines carry the
  speaker map's names (`speakers::display_line`: "You", "Them", "Priya",
  "Priya?" for a guess, "Speaker 2"), and the instructions/page explain the
  labels whether or not voices are told apart (`who_is_who`); the local API's
  `/v1/notes/<id>` hands out `speakers` and each line's `speaker` as stored.
- **`mcp_clients.rs`** — "Add to Claude / ChatGPT / Gemini / Cursor…" (Settings →
  MCP): edits each AI app's own config to launch `yap.exe mcp`. Claude desktop
  (`%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` **and** the MSIX build's
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Claude_*\LocalCache\Roaming\Claude\…`), ChatGPT desktop +
  Codex (`~/.codex/config.toml`, `[mcp_servers.yap]` via toml_edit), Gemini CLI
  (`~/.gemini/settings.json`), Cursor (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`), Claude Code
  (`~/.claude.json`, under Claude Code's own proper-lockfile lock), VS Code
  (`%APPDATA%\Code\User\mcp.json`, `servers`) and Windsurf/Devin Desktop. Only the
  `yap` entry changes (other entries kept as their original text, so key order,
  indent, CRLF and BOM survive; remove = same bytes back), non-plain JSON is left
  alone with the reason, `.bak` on the first edit, temp-file + rename writes.
  Detects installed apps; status added / available / outdated (exe gone) /
  missing. Commands `mcp_clients_status`, `mcp_client_add`, `mcp_client_remove`
  (async, blocking IO off the main thread). Debug builds take
  `YAP_MCP_CLIENT_ROOT` as a stand-in user profile; test mode never touches the
  real one. ⚠ The exe written is this one, **except in a dev build** (debug, not a
  test run): there it's the installed Yap's (`installed_exe`, the uninstall
  entry's `DisplayIcon`) when one is installed — an AI app keeps `yap.exe mcp`
  running, and a child of `<drive>:\t\debug\yap.exe` locks it, so Yap - Dev's next
  build fails with "Access is denied" (2026-10-17, Claude Code's `~/.claude.json`).
  The launcher (`dev-update.ps1`) also stops any such helper before building.

## The Integrations view

- **`IntegrationsView.svelte`** = the
  Integrations surface (OpenWhispr `IntegrationsView.tsx`, local-first cut):
  a **Calendar** card (`CalendarLinkCard.svelte`: Connect → the "Connect
  your calendar" dialog, Manage → Settings → Connectors),
  an **AI apps (MCP)** card (`McpLinkCard.svelte`, Wispr's "Go to MCP" row:
  opens Settings → MCP via ControlPanel's `openSettings`), the Local API card
  (enable toggle + live status/port via `bridge_status`, discovery-file path +
  curl example with copy; the toggle tells Settings' copy via
  `yap-config-patched` so its auto-save can't switch it back), a
  Coding-agents card whose "Copy API guide" button copies a
  paste-into-your-agent endpoint cheat-sheet, and an endpoint reference
  table. (OpenWhispr's Google-Calendar OAuth / cloud API-keys / hosted-MCP
  cards need their paid cloud and are not ported; Yap's MCP is local.)
